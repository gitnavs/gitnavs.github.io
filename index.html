		<h1> Welcome to the Navigators at UC San Diego! </h1> 
		<p>
				The Navigators® is an international, interdenominational Christian ministry established in 1933. Navigators are people who love Jesus Christ and desire to help others know and grow in Him as they "navigate" through life.
		</p>

 		<p>
We are a community of everyday people who impact others for God's glory in our normal pathways of life—where we study, live, work, and play.
