      <h1> About Us </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href = "navigators.org">Navigators®</a> is an international, interdenominational Christian ministry established in 1933. Navigators are people who love Jesus Christ and desire to help others know and grow in Him as they "navigate" through life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Navigators at UC San Diego is a student ministry seeking to reach people with the good news of Jesus, help students grow in their faith relationship with God, and learn how to invest in the lives of others. We’re a community of students exploring our faith, having fun together, and loving our campus. Ultimately, we believe God has a purpose for each of our lives and wants to use ordinary men and women, students at UCSD, to impact the world. Our motto is “To know Christ, make Him known, and help others do the same!”
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’d like to learn more about what the Navigators believe and about our core values, please visit <a href = "https://navigators.org" target = "_blank">navigators.org</a>.
